 ** This program stores and manipulates a database of airports. It can also
 ** print to screen or file the database according to hash index, key, or
 ** as a tree. This program uses a self-adjusting linked-list to solve collisions
 ** that occur within the hash table. Any information that is searched is
 ** moved to the front of the collision linked list. This program is useful
 ** because you can use it to manage a database of airport for your travels.
 ** Latitude and longitude values are useful for airplane pilots who must
 ** navigate at night and must rely only on coordinates to pilot the plane.
 ** This information is processed in the program because of this importance.
